                It is of the utmost importance that you understand not only the reason for your operation but also the exact nature of your ailment. 
                You are therefore encouraged to use the internet and our hyperlinks on this website.
                You absolutely must ask questions about these scenarios should there be any doubt or something unclear in the matter. 
                A second consultation might be necessary as discussion of your case is best done in person. 
                Telephonic consultations are discouraged for various reasons, including time constraints and being impersonal.
                Prior to your surgery you should also be informed of the costs involved and what your medical aid will be prepared to pay. 
                You should have received and signed a quotation for the costs.
                Remember that the practise of Dr Prins is not contracted to any Medical Aid and will have no dealings with them. 
                This unfortunate state of affairs have been brought on by the Medical aid industry by continuously interfering and prescribing to the Medical Profession.

                    <br>ln order to lessen the risks involved, various interventions are implemented, e.g. early mobilization, calve pumps and anti clotting medicine / injections.

                    All care is taken to not suture the drain as part of the wound. <br>lt has been described in literature that drains do sometimes get stuck in a wound. <br>lf this does happen, it is best removed in theatre.</p>

                  <p>Post operative bleeding occurs in most cases, this is however in small amounts and will be absorbed by the dressings applied in theatre.<br>
                    In cases of arthroscopic surgery, especially around the shoulder, sterile water is used to facilitate the operation.<br> 
                    The soft tissues around the operation site absorbs some of this water.<br> 
                    ln some cases the water then oozes out of the wounds after the operation. 
                    lf you feel that your wounds are too wet, please ask the nursing staff to attend to your dressings.<br>
                    To alleviate most of the post-operative oozing, a suction drain will be put into the operation site in theatre.<br> 
                    Please ensure that you do not inadvertently remove your drain.<br> 
                    Although all care is taken intra-operatively to ensure no active bleeding, a blood vessel might start bleeding post operatively as your blood pressure normalizes. ln most cases this bleeding is controlled by pressure bandages.<br> 
                    ln the worst case scenario, you might be taken back to theatre to control bleeding, however the incidence of this happening in this practise is less than one in five years of surgery.</p>

                    You are also encouraged to bring to the attention of the nursing staff as well as Dr Prins, should you have an existing wound/sore elsewhere on your body prior to surgery, as this might jeopardise your operation and you will be best served by rescheduling your surgery.<br>
                    Superficial infection of your wounds might occur.<br> 
                    ln most cases this can be treated with the correct dressings and a possible course of antibiotics.<br> 
                    lt might however be necessary, in a very small percentage of cases, to take you back to theatre and address the problem.<br>

                        The ultimate goal of your treatment by Dr Prins, is for you to have full pain free function of your affected limb. 
ln most cases this is possible providing certain steps are followed. One of these very crucial steps is that you follow the instructions given to you, including the instructions by the physiotherapists. 
We again reiterate that, good directed physiotherapy is of the utmost importance in you regaining full pain free function. 
Be advised that good directed physiotherapy is not getting a massage and having warm pads applied to your affected limb/joint. We recommend the following physiotherapists: <a href="https://www.birkillphysios.co.za/" target="_blank">birkillphysios.co.za</a> and 
<a href="https://colinphysio.co.za/" target="_blank">colinphysio.co.za</a>
Good directed physiotherapy almost always includes the patient doing a lot of hard work. 
Also remember that the protocols set out by our physiotherapists are there for a reason and have reasons why certain exercises are only to be started at a certain time. 
Do not try and "take over" your rehabilitation protocol by doing certain movements etc. prematurely, even if you feel that your operated limb is much better.
This fact cannot be emphasized enough!!
Wounds and surgery sites sometime take longer to fully recover (up to 6-8 months). 
By becoming impatient and trying to force the issue, more harm than good oftentimes is the end result.

                            ln order to provide you with the best continuous care, it is necessary for you to follow-up with Dr Prins. 
The standard follow-up protocol is a post-op follow-up at 10-14 days post discharge. 
At this follow-up your wound will be assessed and redressed as needed. lf you had an operation that needs plaster of Paris immobilization, the temporary plaster slab will be replaced by a circular plaster cast. 
lf you had a major surgery, further follow-ups at 8-10 weeks post operation and sometimes at 6 months post operation might be needed. Please verify and confirm your follow-up visit timorously.
